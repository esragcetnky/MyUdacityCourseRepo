## Overview

The Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. In this repository, you'll find my code, notebooks, and notes for each of the projects in the program. The goal of this repository is to serve as a portfolio showcasing my work and progress in the field of deep learning.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns**
   - Predict daily bike rental ridership based on weather conditions and historical data using a neural network.

2. **Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media**
   - Build a convolutional neural network to classify and tag landmarks in photos for social media applications.

3. **Generate TV Scripts**
   - Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate new episodes of a popular TV show.

4. **Generate Faces**
   - Train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate realistic human faces.

5. **Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model**
   - Develop and deploy a model that performs sentiment analysis on user reviews or social media posts.

Each project has its own directory containing the following:

- **README.md**: Overview and instructions specific to the project.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The main code files for each project, detailing the steps, explanations, and results.
- **Model Files**: Trained models (if applicable) for each project.
- **Data**: Sample data used in the project (Note: Large datasets are typically not included and must be downloaded separately).

## Setup Instructions
